        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti is one of the top three most popular types of pasta, along with penne and macaroni. It's long, thin and, like the other pasta variations, is shaped to hold as much sauce as it can.</p>
        <p>Come and spaghet-it! A dish you can have on the table in less than 45 minutes.</p>
