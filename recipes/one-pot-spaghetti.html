        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti is one of the top three most popular types of pasta, along with penne and macaroni. It's long, thin and, like the other pasta variations, is shaped to hold as much sauce as it can.</p>
        <p>Come and spaghet-it! A dish you can have on the table in less than 45 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground Italian sausage/ground beef</li>
            <li>1 small white onion, diced</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (26 ounce) jar pasta sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti noodles, broken in half</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese for serving (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ground sausage, onions, and garlic in a large pot or skillet with tall sides. Cook over medium heat until sausage is cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
            <li>Stir pasta sauce, water, and Italian seasoning into the pot; bring to a boil. Stir in spaghetti noodles, return to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are cooked through and sauce has thickened, 17 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve topped with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ol>
